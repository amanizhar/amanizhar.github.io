<p style="color: #3EE9B8">Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception received universal critical acclaim, receiving numerous "Game of the Year" and "Best Visuals" awards. Here are a few reviews and remarks about the game :</p>
<h2 style="color: #2C8933"><i> From start to finish, single player to multiplayer, this game sings. The characters, the graphics, the sound, the story – they’re all top notch. If you’re willing to skip Uncharted 3, be prepared to miss one of gaming’s finest moments - <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/24/uncharted-3-drakes-deception-review">IGN</i></a> </h2>

<h2 style="color: #2C8933"><i> Graphics-wise, Uncharted 3 is beyond impeccable – it is one of the finest looking games ever. The trademark rich, colourful and vibrant environments are present and correct, and the cities are better populated, and therefore much more convincing, than before. - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/oct/25/uncharted-3-drakes-deception-review">The Guardian</i></a> </h2>

<h2 style="color: #2C8933"><i> It tells a good story, takes you to a lot of diverse environments and showcases impressive production values. It is a shame the multiplayer was removed from this remaster but I do think this is the definitive way to experience the campaign. Definitely check it out. - <a href="https://gamingpastime.com/uncharted-3-ps4-review/">Gaming Pastime</i></a> </h2>

<h2 style="color: #2C8933"><i>It is a majestic tribute to cinema, a movie game in the literal sense, and your enjoyment will be in precise step with your appreciation of that objective - and whether or not you believe it to be Drake's great deception, or Drake's great delight. - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-3-drakes-deception-review">EuroGamer</i></a> </h2>
